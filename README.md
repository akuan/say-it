# say-it

It just like the `say` command in Mac OSX, but born to be much powerful. We used [Baidu Yuyin](http://yuyin.baidu.com/) as the TTS engine. You need to have network access to use this tool. The pronunciation of Chinese is much better than English.

## Install

    npm install -g say-it

## How to use

  `say-it 'Hello 世界'`

  `say-it '春晓 孟浩然  春眠不觉晓，处处闻啼鸟。夜来风雨声，花落知多少。'`

  `say-it "Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving. ― Albert Einstein"`

## Language support limit
  Due the Baidu Yuyin's limit, right now we only support Chinses and English.

## Updates
